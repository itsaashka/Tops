Dear Shruti,
Regards of the day.

		   Hi Shruti,how are you doing so far?It's been really long since we meet as you didn't 
visited India recently.I just wanted to send a quick email to say a huge thank you for the 
wonderful birthday gift!

It was such a lovely surprise, and I absolutely love the locket which you sent which holds the 
significance of our friendship and reflects that distance doesn't made us apart and how still we are
equally close to each other as we were in the school.And also I'm so glad that you still remember 
which flowers I like and the bouquet which was along with the gift was holding the same flowers 
which I love. 

It really means a lot that you thought of me, especially since we're so far apart. It made my birthday
feel extra special.I miss you tons and hope we can catch up properly soon.

Thanks again!

Love,

Aashka.

Respected Professor,
Regards of the day.

Please accept my sincere apologies for the late submission of my Java assignment.I understand that the
deadline was on 3rd of march, and I am very sorry for failing to meet it.

The reason of my late submission is that it was an medical emergency in my family so I didn't got time to 
complete assignment during that time period so as things got back to normal and routine I immediatedly started
completing my assignment and i completed it in a day and I'm there with my assignment today.

I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and I take full responsibility for my late submission.
I have attached the assignment to this email.So consider it and accept it this time I'll make sure it won't
happen next time.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,
